				<p>I am a passionate language learner. I began learning human languages when I was a child. My favorite human language to learn was German, which I studied for my BA. I have also learned a little Japanese, Classical Greek, Latin, and learned to read a little Spanish, French, and Italian. Eventually my passion for languages developed beyond human languages, and I decided to learn computer languages. Computer languages proved to be a new exciting challenge for me that forced me to master syntax. While one can still be understood with syntax mistakes in human languages, I quickly learned how computer languages would require me to become a true syntax perfectionist.</p>

			<p>Besides human and computer languages, I'm also interested in history, spirituality, and theology. I completed a four-year study of the Bible, church history, and theology as a student in the Episcopal Church's Education for Ministry program. Completing Education for Ministry has enhanced my spirituality with new practices and helped me discern my vocations within lay ministry. I've also been employed as a teller at a credit union for over one year. I also enjoy the world wide web and spend most of my free time web surfing. I enjoy working with others, particularly programmers, so that I can grow as a developer and help other programmers develop their skills too.</p>

			<p>Keep checking in as I post updates on my web development journey. I'll be sure to let you know when I have the skills to make your ideas a reality.</p>
